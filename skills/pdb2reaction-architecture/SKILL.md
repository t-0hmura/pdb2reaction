name: pdb2reaction-architecture
description: Where the source code lives in `pdb2reaction`. 6 physical layer directories (`cli` / `workflows` / `domain` / `backends` / `io` / `core`) + 2 repo-internal forks (`pysisyphus` / `thermoanalysis`). Tells an agent which directory to grep for a given concern (Click option, stage runner, MLIP backend, output writer, chemistry default, link-atom math) before touching code. TRIGGER on questions like "where is X implemented", "which file defines flag Y", "how is the repo organised", "what's safe to refactor". SKIP for usage questions — those belong to `pdb2reaction-cli` / `-overview`.

# pdb2reaction architecture (one-screen map)

## 6 layers + bundled forks

```
pdb2reaction/                          ← the package body, one folder per layer
├── cli/        # L1 — Click root group, --help-advanced, bool normalisation,
│               #      shared option-decorator factories, subcommand resolver.
├── workflows/  # L2 — one file per CLI subcommand (`all.py`, `tsopt.py`,
│               #      `freq.py`, `irc.py`, `dft.py`, `extract.py`, ...).
├── domain/     # L3 — chemistry-aware helpers (bond changes, bond summary,
│               #      element-info repair). No torch / no MLIP dependency.
├── backends/   # L4a — MLIP backend dispatcher + per-backend adapters
│               #       (`uma.py`, `orb.py`, `mace.py`, `aimnet2.py`) +
│               #       xTB ALPB solvent correction.
├── io/         # L4b — summary writer, energy diagram, trajectory plot,
│               #       Hessian cache, PDB altloc fix.
└── core/       # L5 — `defaults.py` (single source of truth for every CLI
                #       default), `utils.py` (PDB / XYZ / plot helpers),
                #       `logging.py`.

pysisyphus/        ← bundled fork of the optimiser / TS / IRC engine.
                     Slimmed to the subset pdb2reaction actually uses; see its
                     own README for the 5 divergent files (chemistry-rule
                     load-bearing). Annotation-only edits in normal workflow.

thermoanalysis/    ← bundled fork for ΔG / ZPE / partition functions.
                     QCData.py is the only consumer; same touch restriction
                     as pysisyphus.
```

Dependency direction is one-way: `L1 → L2 → {L3, L4} → L5`. The bundled forks sit outside the layer graph and may be imported from any layer.

## Where to look first

| concern | open this |
|---|---|
| Default for any CLI flag | `pdb2reaction/core/defaults.py` (single source of truth — grep here before any other file) |
| Subcommand body / orchestration | `pdb2reaction/workflows/<subcmd>.py` |
| New MLIP backend | `pdb2reaction/backends/<backend>.py` + register in `backends/__init__.py:BACKEND_REGISTRY` |
| `--help` / option decorator | `pdb2reaction/cli/common_options.py` (shared) or the subcommand file (inline) |
| Output schema (summary.json, trajectory, energy diagram) | `pdb2reaction/io/` |
| Chemistry rule (link-atom, ECP injection, scatter) | search `# CHEMISTRY-RULE:` markers (lab-sign-off required to edit) |
| TS / IRC / optimiser internals | `pysisyphus/` (annotation-only — chemistry-rule risk) |
| MCP server / agent integration | `pdb2reaction/mcp/` — see [`pdb2reaction-mcp`](../pdb2reaction-mcp/SKILL.md) |

## Hidden constraints to remember

1. **`pdb2reaction/cli/app.py:_LAZY_SUBCOMMANDS`** entries MUST use absolute module paths (`"pdb2reaction.workflows.all"`, never `".all"`). Relative dotted paths silently break the resolver if `default_group.py` moves.
2. **VRAM hygiene**: `# DO NOT INLINE` markers around `del calc; gc.collect(); torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between stages are load-bearing — removing them OOMs the next stage on full-protein systems.
3. **`pyproject.toml [tool.setuptools.packages.find].include`** and `dependencies` arrays are treated as 0-diff for this release line. Adding a vendor / internal dir or pinning a new runtime dep breaks behaviour-level guarantees and is out of scope.
4. **Bundled-fork edits** to `pysisyphus/` / `thermoanalysis/` outside the 5 divergent files require `[CHEMISTRY-RULE:N]` commit prefix and a HEAVY benchmark.
