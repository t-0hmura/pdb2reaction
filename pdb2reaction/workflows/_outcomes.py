"""Product-local scientific-outcome vocabulary for pdb2reaction.

This contract remains product-local to avoid cross-package runtime
dependencies.

The vocabulary separates three orthogonal questions that the single legacy
``status`` field used to conflate:

* did a command / stage actually run?        -> ``executed``
* did the underlying engine converge?        -> ``converged`` (tri-state)
* may a scientific consumer use the result?  -> ``usable``

Fail-closed invariant: no artifact existence and no
finite fallback promotes a *required* nonconverged or missing scientific leaf to
success.  ``converged`` is tri-state: ``True`` means the engine reported
convergence, ``False`` means it explicitly did not, and ``None`` means the
convergence is unknown (a missing signal is treated as *not* converged).
Artifacts remain reportable even when the leaf that produced them is unusable.

These types are additive.  They never replace or rename the legacy public
``status``/``schema_version`` fields; they are serialized alongside them so a
forward-compatible consumers can read explicit outcomes while legacy
consumers that read only ``status`` are unaffected.
