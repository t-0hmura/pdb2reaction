Description
-----------
Extracts an active-site pocket around specified substrate residue(s) from a protein–substrate complex PDB,
then applies geometry-aware truncation (backbone/side-chain capping with safeguards), optionally appends
carbon-only link hydrogens for cut bonds, and logs a simple formal-charge summary.

This module exposes:
- ``extract(args: argparse.Namespace | None = None, api: bool = False)``
- ``extract_api(...)`` convenience wrapper returning a dict result.

Residue inclusion
-----------------
- Always include the substrate residue(s) (and **never delete substrate atoms** during truncation).

- Standard distance cutoff (``--radius``, default 2.6 Å):
  - If ``--exclude-backbone false``: include a residue if **any atom** is within the cutoff of **any substrate atom**.
  - If ``--exclude-backbone true`` (default): for **amino-acid residues** (``resname`` in ``AMINO_ACIDS``),
    the qualifying neighbor atom must be **non-backbone** (not in ``BACKBONE_ATOMS``);
    non–amino-acid residues qualify by **any atom**.

- Independent hetero–hetero proximity (``--radius-het2het``):
  add residues if a **substrate hetero atom** (element not in {C,H}) is within the cutoff of a
  **neighbor hetero atom** (element not in {C,H}). This is evaluated against *all* atoms in the structure
  (typically protein O/N/S, cofactors, ions, other ligands, etc.).
  With ``--exclude-backbone true``, amino-acid neighbors must still be **non-backbone** atoms.

- Waters are included by default (``--include-H2O true``; any of: HOH/WAT/H2O/DOD/TIP/TIP3/SOL).

- ``--selected-resn`` force-includes residues by residue ID tokens (chain and insertion codes supported).
  *In multi-structure mode, forced residues must exist in every input structure.*

Backbone-contact context (only when ``--exclude-backbone false``)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When backbone exclusion is OFF, the selector also tracks amino-acid residues that contact the substrate
via a **backbone atom name** (any of ``BACKBONE_ATOMS``) within either cutoff. For each such residue:
- include its immediate peptide-adjacent N-side and C-side amino-acid neighbors
  (peptide adjacency is determined by **C(prev)–N(next) ≤ 1.9 Å**, i.e., geometry-based).
- if a peptide-adjacent neighbor is not found on a side (true terminus / chain break by geometry),
  preserve the corresponding terminal cap atoms on the contacting residue:
  - N-side missing → keep N/H* (do not delete N-cap)
  - C-side missing → keep C/O/OXT (do not delete C-cap)

Safeguards / special inclusions
-------------------------------
- **Disulfide safeguard:** if a selected CYS/CYX forms an SG–SG contact ≤ 2.5 Å with another CYS/CYX,
  include both partners.

- **Proline safeguard (TER-aware by geometry):** if a selected **PRO** has a peptide-adjacent preceding
  amino acid (C–N ≤ 1.9 Å), include that preceding residue.
  For that neighbor:
  - **CA is always kept**.
  - With ``--exclude-backbone true``, also keep **C** and **O/OXT** to preserve the peptide bond into PRO–N.

Truncation (capping)
--------------------
Truncation decides which atoms to delete from **non-substrate** residues; substrate residues are kept intact.

- TER-aware segmentation uses the peptide-adjacency test (C–N ≤ 1.9 Å) to split the selected residues in
  each chain into peptide-bonded segments (this is geometric; it typically avoids chain breaks when atoms
  are missing or far apart).

- With ``--exclude-backbone false``:
  - **Continuous peptide segments** keep internal backbone; only terminal caps are removed:
    - N-cap (first residue of a segment): remove N/H* (unless PRO/HYP or explicitly preserved by the
      backbone-contact terminus rule).
    - C-cap (last residue of a segment): remove C/O/OXT (unless explicitly preserved by the
      backbone-contact terminus rule).
  - **Isolated single residues** are reduced to a side-chain-only representation:
    remove N/H*, CA/HA*, and C/O/OXT.
    - **Exception:** if the backbone-contact terminus rule preserves an N-cap and/or C-cap on this residue,
      the corresponding N/H* and/or C/O/OXT atoms are retained (CA/HA* removal still applies for non‑PRO/HYP).
    - **PRO/HYP** retain N, CA, and H/HA* atoms to keep the ring, but may still lose C/O/OXT as C-cap.

- With ``--exclude-backbone true`` (default):
  delete the full backbone set (``BACKBONE_ALL``) from every **non-substrate amino-acid** residue.
  - **PRO/HYP** retain N, CA, and H/HA* (ring preservation).
  - The PRO N-side neighbor preservation rule above re-adds CA always, and (when backbone exclusion is on)
    preserves C and O/OXT for the neighbor if peptide-adjacent.

- **Non–amino-acid residues** are never modified by the capping logic: even if they contain atom names
  like N/CA/H, they are not subject to amino-acid backbone deletion.

Link hydrogens (``--add-linkH``)
--------------------------------
Optionally adds carbon-only link H atoms for bonds cut by truncation.

- Placement:
  - Normal residues: test these possible cut bonds:
    **CB–CA**, **CA–N**, **CA–C**.
  - **PRO/HYP**: test **CA–C** only.
  - A link H is added only if:
    1) the **parent atom** remains in the output,
    2) the **partner atom** exists in the original residue and is deleted by truncation, and
    3) the parent atom is **Carbon**.
  - Coordinates: 1.09 Å from the parent along the (parent → deleted-partner) unit vector.

- Output format:
  - Link H atoms are written as a contiguous **HETATM** block with atom name **HL** in residue **LKH**,
    chain **L**, one pseudo-residue per H (resseq 1..N).
  - Atom serial numbers continue from the maximum serial present in the main (truncated) output block.
  - A **TER** record is placed immediately before the link-H block (if one is already present, another
    TER may still appear depending on writer output).

- Multi-structure mode:
  - The code requires that the **set and ordering of link-H targets** (which cut bonds would be capped)
    is identical across models; otherwise it raises an error. Coordinates remain model-specific.
  - This consistency check is performed regardless of whether link-H atoms are ultimately written.

Charge summary
--------------
A simple nominal-charge summary is computed from the **first** input structure and logged:

- ``AMINO_ACIDS`` provides nominal integer charges for many amino-acid residue names
  (standard, protonation variants, common modified residues, and N-/C-terminus variants).
- ``ION`` provides formal charges for common ions by residue name. Waters are always 0.

Residues are categorized as:
- **protein**: residues whose ``resname`` is in ``AMINO_ACIDS``
- **ions**: residues whose ``resname`` is in ``ION``
- **waters**: residues in ``WATER_RES`` (always 0)
- **unknown**: anything else (default 0 unless ``--ligand-charge`` is provided)

``--ligand-charge`` handling (applies only to **unknown** residues):
- ``--ligand-charge <number>``: assign the given total charge equally across **unknown substrate residues**;
  if there are none, distribute across **all unknown residues** in the pocket.
- ``--ligand-charge 'RES1:Q1,RES2:Q2'``: per-resname charges for unknown residues; unspecified unknowns remain 0.

The logged summary includes:
- net protein charge, net unknown/ligand charge, ion list and net ion charge, and total pocket charge.

Multi-structure ensembles
-------------------------
Multiple input PDBs can be provided with ``-i``:

- Requirements / assumptions:
  - All inputs must have the same atom count.
  - Atom ordering is assumed identical; it is **spot-checked** on the first and last ~10 atoms.

- Selection logic:
  - Each structure is selected independently using the same rules.
  - The **union** of selected residues (by a cross-structure key: chain, hetflag, resseq, insertion code, resname)
    is applied to all structures. This means a residue selected in any model is included in every model.
  - Disulfide inclusion, PRO N-side neighbor inclusion, forced inclusion (``--selected-resn``), and (if enabled)
    backbone-contact neighbor inclusion are also unioned.

- Outputs:
  - Provide **one** output path → write a single **multi-MODEL** PDB (one MODEL per input).
  - Provide **N** output paths where **N == number of inputs** → write **N** single-model PDBs.
  - If ``-o`` is omitted with multiple inputs → defaults to per-file outputs
    ``pocket_{input_basename}.pdb`` (in the current directory unless a path is provided).

- Diagnostics:
  - Raw atom counts (before truncation) and kept atom counts (after truncation) are logged per model.

Substrate specification
-----------------------
``-c/--center`` accepts:

- a **PDB path**:
  substrate residues are identified by **exact atom-name + coordinate match** (tolerance 1e-3 Å) against
  the *first* input structure. In multi-structure mode, the matched residues are then propagated to other
  inputs by residue IDs (chain/resseq/icode), so numbering must be consistent across inputs.

- a list of **residue IDs** (comma/space separated):
  ``'123,124'``, ``'A:123,B:456'``, ``'123A'``, ``'A:123A'`` (insertion codes supported).
  Chain may be omitted (matches all chains); insertion code may be omitted (matches any insertion code for that resseq).

- a list of **residue names** (comma/space separated, case-insensitive), e.g., ``'GPP,SAM'``.
  If multiple residues share the same residue name, **all** matches are included and a WARNING is logged.

Outputs (& Paths)
-----------------
- The extractor writes standard PDB text via Biopython PDBIO plus optional appended link-H HETATM records.
- Output directories are not created automatically; ensure the directory for ``-o`` exists.

Defaults:
- Single input and no ``-o``: ``pocket.pdb``
- Multiple inputs and no ``-o``: ``pocket_{input_basename}.pdb`` for each input

Link hydrogens, logs, and programmatic use
------------------------------------------
- When added, the link-H block follows a TER as contiguous HETATM records (HL/LKH, chain L).
- INFO logs summarize substrate matching, residue selection, atom counts, and the charge summary
  (set ``--verbose false`` to keep warnings only).
- Programmatic use:
  - ``extract(..., api=True)`` and ``extract_api(...)`` return
    ``{"outputs": [...], "counts": [...], "charge_summary": {...}}``.

Notes
-----
- Defaults / behavior:
  - ``--radius`` default: **2.6 Å**. If given **0**, internally clamped to **0.001 Å**.
  - ``--radius-het2het`` default: **0 Å** (effectively off); internally clamped to **0.001 Å** if ``0`` is given.
  - ``--include-H2O`` default: **true**.
  - ``--exclude-backbone`` default: **true**.
  - ``--add-linkH`` default: **true**.
  - ``--verbose`` default: **true** for the CLI entry; ``extract_api(..., verbose=False)`` defaults to warnings only.
  - ``--ligand-charge`` default: **None** (unknown residues remain 0 unless set).
  - Input PDBs are assumed to be **single-model**; files containing ``MODEL``/``ENDMDL`` records are not supported.

- Geometry thresholds:
  - Peptide adjacency: **C(prev)–N(next) ≤ 1.9 Å** (distance-based).
  - Disulfide detection: **SG–SG ≤ 2.5 Å**.
  - Link-H distance: **1.09 Å** (C–H) along the cut-bond direction.
  - Exact match tolerance for substrate PDB: **1e‑3 Å** per atom.
