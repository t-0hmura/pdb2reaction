"""Opt-in strict-determinism setup for the MLIP backends.

Activated by the ``--deterministic`` CLI flag (present on every compute
subcommand) or the ``PDB2REACTION_STRICT_DETERMINISTIC=1`` environment variable.
Process-global and idempotent: the first activation patches the
non-deterministic ``Tensor.index_reduce_(reduce="mean")`` op (which has no
deterministic CUDA kernel in torch <= 2.8 and crashes under
``use_deterministic_algorithms``) to a ``scatter_reduce`` detour, then enables
``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`` + cuDNN determinism + fixed seeds.

Design notes:
- **Patch first.** Native strict mode is *known* to crash on
  ``index_reduce_``; probing it first would only waste a guaranteed failure.
  The shim is applied before strict mode is turned on.
- **Fail loud.** If the patch target is gone under a torch upgrade, or strict
  mode rejects an op with no deterministic kernel, raise — never silently
  degrade to ``warn_only``.
- **Scope.** Requests same-software/hardware-stack determinism for operations
  controlled by PyTorch. It cannot guarantee cross-version/cross-hardware
  identity or control arbitrary third-party/custom kernels and calculators.
- **Cost.** Deterministic scatter/reduce kernels may be slower, and the runtime
  monkey-patch is version-sensitive. Default OFF.
