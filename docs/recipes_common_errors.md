# Common Error Recipes

Use this page when you know the symptom but do not know which subcommand page to open first.
For full details, keep [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) open in parallel.

## Quick routing

| Symptom | Start here | Then read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing element columns / extraction aborts | `add-elem-info` on the original PDB | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| "Charge is required" errors | Set `-q/--charge` and `-m/--multiplicity` explicitly | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| Energies/states look wrong after a run | Re-check charge/multiplicity policy in CLI conventions | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| DMF mode import errors (`cyipopt`) | Install `cyipopt` in the active environment | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| TSOPT/IRC does not converge | Reduce step aggressiveness, increase cycles, validate TS quality first | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| CUDA/GPU runtime mismatch | Verify `torch.cuda.is_available()` and CUDA build pairing | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| Plot export failures | Install Chrome runtime for Plotly export | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |

## Recipe 1: Extraction fails before MEP starts

- Signal:
 - Errors mention missing element symbols, atom-count mismatch, or empty pockets.
- First checks:
 - Confirm all inputs are prepared by the same workflow and atom ordering is consistent.
 - Ensure element columns are present before running `extract` or `all`.
- Typical fix path:
 - Repair elements -> rerun extraction -> confirm pocket size and residue inclusion.

## Recipe 2: Charge/spin validation fails

- Signal:
 - Errors mention unresolved charge, especially for non-`.gjf` inputs.
- First checks:
 - Ensure net charge and multiplicity are physically correct for the target state.
 - If using residue maps, validate each residue key in `--ligand-charge`.
 - Verify the resolution rules in [CLI Conventions](cli_conventions.md) when results look physically inconsistent.
- Typical fix path:
 - Prefer explicit `-q` and `-m` for critical runs, then retry scan/path/tsopt.

## Recipe 3: Environment blockers

- Signal:
 - DMF import failures, CUDA mismatch, or unavailable plotting backends.
- First checks:
 - Confirm optional dependencies are installed in the active env.
 - Validate GPU visibility and PyTorch CUDA compatibility.
- Typical fix path:
 - Repair environment first, then rerun with `--dry-run` (see `--help-advanced`) before full execution.

## Recipe 4: Convergence and post-processing failures

- Signal:
 - TSOPT stalls, IRC branches look unstable, or MEP refinement stops unexpectedly.
- First checks:
 - Confirm TS candidate quality: exactly one imaginary frequency with |ν| ≥ 100 cm⁻¹.
 - Reduce optimizer aggressiveness and increase cycle limits.
- Typical fix path:
 - Run a smaller diagnostic case, tune thresholds/step sizes, then scale back up.
