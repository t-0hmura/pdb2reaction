# `path-opt` (MEP between two structures)

`path-opt` finds a minimum-energy path (MEP) between two structures, a reactant and a product, in one pass with GSM (growing string method, the default) or DMF (direct max flux). It writes the trajectory of the structural change that connects R and P, and the highest-energy image (HEI) as a TS candidate.

---

## What it is for

* **A first MEP from R and P**: get a path and its energy profile from two endpoint structures, without recursive refinement.
* **A TS candidate for `tsopt`**: `hei.pdb` (or `hei.xyz`) is the starting structure for [`tsopt`](tsopt.md).
* **Comparing GSM and DMF**: run the same pair with `--mep-mode gsm` and `--mep-mode dmf` and compare the paths.

To give three or more structures at once, use the [Endpoint mode](quickstart-all.md) of `all`. To try whether intermediates between R and P can be detected automatically, use [`path-search`](path-search.md).

## Examples

### 1. Two endpoints

Give the reactant and the product after one `-i`, with the charge and the spin multiplicity.

```bash
pdb2reaction path-opt -i reactant.pdb product.pdb -q 0 -m 1 --out-json --out-dir ./result_path_opt
```

The console line `[write] Wrote '…/hei.xyz'.` shows that the TS candidate was written. In `result.json` (`--out-json`), `scientific_status` is `success` when every requested stage (endpoint pre-optimization, MEP) converged, otherwise `partial` or `failed`. `barrier_kcal` is the HEI energy relative to the first image, and `hei_index` is the position of the HEI on the path.

### 2. Set the endpoint pre-optimization limit

Both endpoints are pre-optimized by default; `--preopt-max-cycles` caps each pass, and `--no-preopt` skips it for optimized endpoints.

```bash
pdb2reaction path-opt -i reactant.pdb product.pdb -q 0 -m 1 \
  --preopt-max-cycles 20000 --out-dir ./result_path_opt_preopt
```

### 3. DMF instead of GSM

DMF needs `cyipopt`; here we also use fewer movable images.

```bash
pdb2reaction path-opt -i reactant.pdb product.pdb -q 0 -m 1 \
  --mep-mode dmf --max-nodes 12 --out-dir ./result_path_opt_dmf
```

### 4. Quick pass: freeze cap parents, no climbing

Skip the climbing-image search for a fast first look; the parents of cap hydrogens stay frozen.

```bash
pdb2reaction path-opt -i reactant.pdb product.pdb -q 0 -m 1 \
  --freeze-links --no-climb --out-dir ./result_path_opt_quick
```

## How it works

1. **Preparing the endpoints**:
Each endpoint is pre-optimized, with L-BFGS by default (`--opt-mode`). The product is then rigidly aligned to the reactant on the frozen atoms, and the frozen atoms are moved step by step onto their reactant positions while the other atoms relax. The parents of {ref}`cap hydrogens <link-hydrogen-and-frozen-atoms>` are frozen by default (`--freeze-links`).
2. **Growing and refining the path**:
GSM grows a string of `--max-nodes` movable images between the two endpoints and optimizes it to `--thresh-gsm`. With `--climb` (on by default), a climbing-image search then pushes the highest image toward the saddle. DMF instead builds an interpolated path and optimizes it with IPOPT (an interior-point optimizer) to `--dmf-tol`.
3. **Writing the HEI**:
The image with the highest energy on the final path becomes the HEI. `hei.xyz` holds it with its energy on the comment line.

## Reading the HEI

| Where the HEI is | Meaning | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inside the path (`hei_index` between `1` and `n_images − 2`; both are keys of `result.json`, and `n_images` is the number of images on the path) | A TS candidate | Optimize it with [`tsopt`](tsopt.md), then run [`irc`](irc.md) |
| At an endpoint (`hei_index` is `0` or `n_images − 1`) | Not a TS candidate: no image between the endpoints lies above the higher endpoint | Check the endpoints, or get a candidate another way (see {ref}`When a TS search fails <ts-search-fails>`) |

The HEI is the top of an approximate path, not a TS. A successful TS optimization gives one imaginary mode along the reaction coordinate; the HEI becomes a TS once `tsopt` gives n_imag = 1 and IRC from that TS reaches the intended R and P.

## Output files

`path-opt` writes these files to `--out-dir`:

```text
result_path_opt/
├─ final_geometries_trj.xyz   # Final path, every image, energies on the comment lines
├─ final_geometries.pdb       # Same path as PDB (PDB/mmCIF input; DMF names it final_geometries_trj.pdb)
├─ hei.xyz                    # HEI, the TS candidate, with its energy on the comment line
├─ hei.pdb                    # Same HEI as PDB (PDB/mmCIF input)
├─ align_refine/              # Endpoint alignment and relaxation files
├─ result.json                # Summary (--out-json)
└─ summary.json               # Same content as result.json (with --out-json)
```

Open `final_geometries_trj.xyz` to watch the path. Pass `hei.pdb` to `tsopt` for PDB/mmCIF input, so that `-l` and `--freeze-links` apply there; with `hei.xyz`, add `--ref-pdb`. For PDB, mmCIF, or `.gjf` input, the outputs are also written in that format under the same name; {ref}`mmCIF input <mmcif-input>`, and PDB input too large for the PDB columns, also get `.cif` files that keep the original identifiers. With DMF, the path is not written as `.gjf`. `--dump` also keeps the optimizer trajectories.

The console prints the MEP progress cycle by cycle, with timings.

See the [generated CLI reference](reference/commands/path_opt.md) for every option.

> **Note:** In YAML (`--config`), the [`gs`](yaml-reference.md#gs) section sets the GSM string, [`dmf`](yaml-reference.md#dmf) the DMF path, and [`stopt`](yaml-reference.md#stopt) the string optimizer. `stopt.lbfgs` and `stopt.rfo` also set the endpoint optimizers, as `opt.lbfgs` and `opt.rfo` do.

## Notes

* **Frozen atoms move slightly with DMF**: DMF holds frozen atoms with a harmonic restraint (k = 300 eV/Å², YAML `dmf.k_fix`) instead of fixing them, so they can drift a little from their reference positions; GSM keeps them fixed. See {ref}`Freeze atoms and restrain distances <freeze-atoms-and-restraints>`.
* **DMF needs `cyipopt`**: install it from conda-forge before you run `--mep-mode dmf`; `pydmf` comes with `pdb2reaction`. The default `--dmf-backend gpu` stops with an error when CUDA is unavailable; use `--dmf-backend cpu` then, or after a GPU out-of-memory error.
* **DMF and implicit solvent cannot be combined**: with an MLIP backend, `--mep-mode dmf` together with `--solvent` stops with an error. Use GSM for a path with solvent.
* **Options DMF ignores**: `--climb`, `--dump`, and `--fix-ends` are accepted but not used by DMF.
* **Conflicting optimizer settings in YAML**: setting the same key to different values in `opt:` and in the section of the optimizer that runs (`lbfgs:`, `opt.lbfgs:`, `stopt.lbfgs:`, or the `rfo` equivalents) stops the run with an error.
