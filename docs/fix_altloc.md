# `fix-altloc`

## Overview
`fix-altloc` removes alternate location (altLoc) indicators from PDB files by
selecting the best conformer for each atom based on occupancy and dropping
duplicates.

### What it does
1. Blank the PDB altLoc column (column 17, 1-based) with a single space.
   - This is a 1-character replacement (no shifting / no reformatting).
2. If the same atom appears multiple times due to alternate locations
   (altLoc like A/B/... or custom labels like H/L), keep the "best" one:
   - Highest occupancy first
   - If tied (or occupancy missing), keep the earliest one in the file

### Handled records
- `ATOM` / `HETATM`: altLoc selection and blanking
- `ANISOU`: kept only if the corresponding ATOM/HETATM line (same serial) is kept

### Automatic skip behavior
By default, if a file contains **no altLoc characters** (all column 17 positions
are blank), the file is **skipped** and no output is written. Use `--force` to
process files regardless of altLoc presence.

## Usage
```bash
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i INPUT.pdb [-o OUTPUT.pdb] [OPTIONS]
```

## Examples
```bash
# Process a single file (output: INPUT_clean.pdb)
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i 1abc.pdb

# Specify output file
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i 1abc.pdb -o 1abc_fixed.pdb

# Process a directory recursively
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i ./structures -o ./cleaned --recursive True

# Overwrite input files in-place (creates .bak backups)
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i ./structures --inplace True --recursive True

# Force processing even if no altLoc is detected
pdb2reaction fix-altloc -i 1abc.pdb -o 1abc_fixed.pdb --force True
```

## Workflow
1. Check if the input file contains any non-blank altLoc characters (column 17).
   - If no altLoc is found and `--force` is not set, skip the file.
2. For each ATOM/HETATM record, build an identity key ignoring the altLoc field:
   - record name, atom name, residue name, chain ID, residue sequence, insertion code, segID
3. Among atoms with the same identity key, select the one with:
   - Highest occupancy (columns 55–60)
   - If tied, the earliest appearance in the file
4. Write output with:
   - Only the selected atoms retained
   - altLoc column (17) blanked to a single space
   - ANISOU records filtered to match retained atoms

## CLI options
| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i, --input PATH` | Input PDB file or directory. | Required |
| `-o, --out PATH` | Output file (if input is a file) or directory (if input is a directory). | `<input>_clean.pdb` |
| `--recursive {True\|False}` | Process `*.pdb` files recursively when input is a directory. | `False` |
| `--inplace {True\|False}` | Overwrite input file(s) in-place (creates `.bak` backup). | `False` |
| `--overwrite {True\|False}` | Allow overwriting existing output files. | `False` |
| `--force {True\|False}` | Process files even if no altLoc is detected. | `False` |

## Outputs
- A PDB file with alternate locations removed:
  - `<input>_clean.pdb` by default (when `-o/--out` is omitted)
  - `OUTPUT.pdb` if `-o/--out` is provided
  - Original file overwritten if `--inplace` is set (backup saved as `<input>.pdb.bak`)

## Integration with `all` workflow
When running the `pdb2reaction all` workflow, `fix-altloc` is automatically
invoked as a preflight step **after** `add-elem-info` (if element fields were
missing) and **before** pocket extraction. This ensures that:
1. Element symbols are populated first
2. Alternate locations are resolved to a single conformer
3. The extraction step receives clean, unambiguous coordinates

Files are only processed if altLoc characters are detected; otherwise, the
original file is passed through unchanged.

## Handling different atom counts between altLoc states

When different altLoc states contain different atoms (e.g., altLoc A has atoms
N, CA, CB, CG while altLoc B has N, CA, CB, CD), `fix-altloc` handles this correctly:

- **Duplicate atoms** (same residue + atom name in multiple altLocs, e.g., N, CA, CB):
  The best one is selected based on occupancy (highest first, then earliest in file).
- **Unique atoms** (only present in one altLoc, e.g., CG in A, CD in B):
  ALL unique atoms are preserved in the output.

This ensures the output structure contains all atoms from all altLoc states,
with only true duplicates resolved to a single conformer.

**Example:**
```
Input:
  ATOM   1  N  AALA A 1 ...  0.50  # altLoc A
  ATOM   2  CA AALA A 1 ...  0.50  # altLoc A
  ATOM   3  CG AALA A 1 ...  0.50  # altLoc A only
  ATOM   4  N  BALA A 1 ...  0.40  # altLoc B
  ATOM   5  CA BALA A 1 ...  0.40  # altLoc B
  ATOM   6  CD BALA A 1 ...  0.40  # altLoc B only

Output:
  ATOM   1  N   ALA A 1 ...  0.50  # from A (higher occ)
  ATOM   2  CA  ALA A 1 ...  0.50  # from A (higher occ)
  ATOM   3  CG  ALA A 1 ...  0.50  # kept (A only)
  ATOM   6  CD  ALA A 1 ...  0.40  # kept (B only)
```

## Notes
- Atom serial numbers are **NOT renumbered** (gaps may remain after duplicate removal).
- `CONECT` and other connectivity/annotation records are **NOT updated**.
- Only column 17 (altLoc) is modified; coordinates, occupancies, B-factors, charges,
  insertion codes, and record ordering stay untouched (except for duplicate removal).
- MODEL/ENDMDL blocks are processed independently.

## API usage
For programmatic use, the module exports:
```python
from pdb2reaction.fix_altloc import has_altloc, fix_altloc_file

# Check if a file has altLoc
if has_altloc(Path("input.pdb")):
    # Fix altLoc
    was_processed = fix_altloc_file("input.pdb", "output.pdb", overwrite=True)
```
