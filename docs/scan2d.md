# `scan2d` (2D restrained grid scan)

`scan2d` relaxes every point of a grid over two coordinates with harmonic restraints and records the energy without the restraints, giving a 2D energy map of the reaction.

---

## What it is for

* **Locating the TS region**: see where the saddle between the reactant and product basins lies before a path search or TS optimization.
* **Viewing the landscape before the MEP**: check whether two events, such as bond formation and proton transfer, happen together or one after the other, before refining the minimum-energy path (MEP).

The default backend is **UMA** (Meta); `-b/--backend` also selects **ORB**, **MACE**, **AIMNet2**, or DFT (`dft`). For a single path driven by one or more coordinates, use [`scan`](scan.md); for three coordinates, use [`scan3d`](scan3d.md).

---

## Examples

The examples use `input.pdb`, the cluster model cut from the bundled enzyme structure with [extract](extract.md), and take its charge from `-l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3'`.

```bash
pdb2reaction extract -i examples/1.R.pdb -c 'SAM,GPP,MG' -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' -o input.pdb
```

Its PDB has an empty chain column, so an atom is written as residue name, residue number, and atom name, in any order, separated by commas or spaces.

### 1. From a YAML spec

Write the two ranges under `pairs:`. With the default step of 0.2 Å, this file gives a 9 × 9 grid.

```yaml
# scan2d.yaml
pairs:
  - ["SAM,320,CS1", "GPP,321,C7", 1.50, 3.00]
  - ["GPP,321,H11", "GLU,186,OE2", 0.90, 2.50]
```

Give the structure, the charge, and the file; add `--out-json` to also get `result.json`.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan2d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' -m 1 -s scan2d.yaml --out-json -o ./result_scan2d/
```

Open `result_scan2d/scan2d_map.png` for the contour map and `scan2d_landscape.html` for the 3D surface; `result.json` gives `scientific_status` and the number of usable points.

### 2. Inline literal

The same two ranges can be written on the command line as one literal.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan2d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    -s '[("SAM,320,CS1","GPP,321,C7",1.50,3.00),("GPP,321,H11","GLU,186,OE2",0.90,2.50)]'
```

### 3. Pre-optimize, dump, and set the baseline

Optimize the input before the scan, keep the inner-loop trajectories, and measure the relative energies from the lowest usable point.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan2d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    -s '[("SAM,320,CS1","GPP,321,C7",1.50,3.00),("GPP,321,H11","GLU,186,OE2",0.90,2.50)]' \
    --max-step-size 0.20 --dump -o ./result_scan2d/ --opt-mode grad \
    --preopt --baseline min
```

---

## How it works

1. **Starting structure and grid**:
The {ref}`charge <charge-specification>` comes from `-q` or `-l`. With `--preopt`, the input is first optimized without restraints; if that does not converge, the input geometry is used. Each axis gets ceil(|high − low| / h) + 1 evenly spaced values, both ends included, where h is `--max-step-size` (Å) for a distance and `--max-angle-step-size` or `--max-dihedral-step-size` (degrees) for an angle or dihedral. The values are visited from the one closest to the starting structure.
2. **Outer and inner loops**:
For each d₁ value, the structure is relaxed with only the d₁ restraint. The inner loop then scans d₂ with both restraints, starting each point from the nearest point that has already converged.
3. **Relaxation at each point**:
A harmonic restraint E = ½ k (q − q_target)² holds each coordinate q at its target (k is `--restraint-k`), and L-BFGS (`--opt-mode grad`, default) or RFO (`--opt-mode hess`) relaxes the rest. The energy is then computed without the restraints, and the structure is written under `grid/`.
4. **Table and plots**:
After the last point, all points go into `surface.csv`. The usable points are interpolated with radial basis functions (RBF) on a 50 × 50 grid and drawn as a contour map and a 3D surface.

## Reading surface.csv

`surface.csv` has one row per grid point and one reference row.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `i`, `j` | Grid indices. Index 0 is the value closest to the starting structure, so the indices follow the visiting order, not ascending values |
| `d1_A`, `d2_A` (also `q1`, `q2`) | Coordinate values measured after the relaxation. The `_A` names are kept for every axis, so an angle axis holds degrees; `q1_unit` and `q2_unit` give the unit (`angstrom` or `degree`) |
| `target_d1_A`, `target_d2_A` (also `target_q1`, `target_q2`) | Restraint targets of the point |
| `energy_hartree` | Energy without the restraints (Hartree) |
| `energy_kcal` | Energy relative to the baseline (kcal/mol) |
| `bias_converged` | Whether the restrained relaxation converged |
| `is_preopt` | `true` only for the reference row |
| `d1_label`, `d2_label` | Axis labels used in the plots |

* **Usable points**: a point is usable when its relaxation converged, its energy is finite, and its structure was written. Only usable points set the baseline and enter the plots.
* **Verdict**: in `result.json` (`--out-json`), `scientific_status` is `success` when every grid point is usable, `partial` when only some are (exit status 0), and `failed` when none is (exit status 1). `n_points_attempted` and `n_points_usable` give the counts. For points that do not converge, see {ref}`max_cycles and plateau stops <troubleshooting-max-cycles>`.
* **Next step**: the plots are interpolated, so pass a computed point near the saddle, `grid/point_*.pdb`, to [`tsopt`](tsopt.md) (for `.xyz`, add `--ref-pdb`). Points in the two basins can be inputs for [`path-search`](path-search.md).

## Output files

After a run, `--out-dir` contains the following files.

```text
result_scan2d/
├─ surface.csv                   # grid table with the reference row
├─ scan2d_map.png                # 2D contour map
├─ scan2d_landscape.html         # 3D surface (open in a browser)
├─ grid/
│  ├─ point_i150_j090.xyz        # relaxed structure of each grid point
│  ├─ preopt_iDDD_jDDD.xyz       # starting structure (the reference row)
│  └─ inner_path_d1_000_trj.xyz  # inner-loop trajectory for each d₁ value (--dump)
└─ result.json                   # summary (--out-json); summary.json holds the same content
```

Start with `surface.csv` and the two plots; the structure of each point is under `grid/`. In `result.json`, `grid_points[]` maps each grid index to its values, targets, energy, convergence, and structure file; use it instead of reading values back from file names.

* **File names**: the number after `i` or `j` (the tag `DDD`) is the target × 100 (Å, or degrees for an angle), padded to at least three digits, not the grid index of `surface.csv`: `d1 = 1.50 Å, d2 = 0.90 Å` gives `point_i150_j090.xyz`, and an angle of 120° gives `12000`. When two points round to the same tag, the later file name gets `_grid_III_JJJ` with the point's `i` and `j` from `surface.csv`.
* **Other formats**: with PDB or mmCIF input, each structure is also written as `.pdb`, and with Gaussian input as `.gjf`. {ref}`mmCIF input <mmcif-input>` also gets `.cif` with the original identifiers.

## Notes

* **Two ranges in one literal**: `-s` takes exactly two ranges, in one inline literal or under `pairs:` in a YAML/JSON file. For staged scans, use [`scan`](scan.md).
* **PDB with chains**: the {ref}`positional form <scan-list-spec>` `A:SAM:320:CS1` picks one atom without ambiguity.
* **Restraint strength in YAML**: `bias.k` applies when `--restraint-k` is omitted.
* **Cap hydrogens**: `--freeze-links` (default on) fixes the parent atoms of the {ref}`cap hydrogens <link-hydrogen-and-frozen-atoms>` of an extracted cluster.
* **Cycle limit**: `--relax-max-cycles` (default `100000`) limits each relaxation; an explicit value overrides YAML `opt.max_cycles`.
* **Reference row**: `i = j = -1` and `is_preopt = true` hold the starting structure. The row stays in the table but is never a grid point, a baseline, or a plotted point.
* **Baseline**: `--baseline min` (default) puts zero at the lowest usable point; `--baseline first` puts it at point `(i, j) = (0, 0)`, or at the lowest usable point when `(0, 0)` is not usable.
* **Too few usable points**: with fewer than three usable points, or with all of them on one line, only the plots are skipped. The run prints `[plot] NOTE: Plots skipped: …` and exits with status 0. With no usable point it prints `[plot] No finite data for plotting.` and exits with status 1.
* **PNG export**: the PNG is written with Plotly and Kaleido. If the export fails, the run prints `[plot] NOTE: PNG export skipped: …`, still writes the HTML surface, and leaves the PNG out of `result.json`.
