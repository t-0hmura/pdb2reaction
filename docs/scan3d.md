# `scan3d` (3D restrained grid scan)

`scan3d` relaxes every point of a grid over three coordinates with harmonic restraints, records the energy without the restraints, and draws the energy volume as isosurfaces in an HTML page.

---

## What it is for

* **Reactions that involve three coordinates at once**: see the energy landscape when, for example, a bond forms, another breaks, and a proton moves in the same step.
* **Redrawing a finished grid**: plot an existing `surface.csv` again over another energy range (`--csv`).

The default backend is **UMA** (Meta); `-b/--backend` also selects **ORB**, **MACE**, **AIMNet2**, or DFT (`dft`). For a single path driven by one or more coordinates, use [`scan`](scan.md); for two coordinates, use [`scan2d`](scan2d.md).

---

## Examples

The examples use `input.pdb`, the cluster model cut from the bundled enzyme structure with [extract](extract.md), and take its charge from `-l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3'`.

```bash
pdb2reaction extract -i examples/1.R.pdb -c 'SAM,GPP,MG' -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' -o input.pdb
```

Its PDB has an empty chain column, so an atom is written as residue name, residue number, and atom name, in any order, separated by commas or spaces.

### 1. From a YAML spec

Write the three ranges under `pairs:` and add `--out-json` to also get `result.json`. With the default step of 0.2 Å, this file gives a 9 × 9 × 7 grid (567 points).

```yaml
# scan3d.yaml
pairs:
  - ["SAM,320,CS1", "GPP,321,C7", 1.50, 3.00]
  - ["GPP,321,H11", "GLU,186,OE2", 0.90, 2.50]
  - ["SAM,320,SD", "SAM,320,CS1", 1.80, 3.00]
```

```bash
pdb2reaction scan3d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' -s scan3d.yaml --out-json -o ./result_scan3d/
```

Open `result_scan3d/scan3d_density.html` in a browser for the isosurfaces; `result.json` gives `scientific_status` and the number of usable points (`n_points_usable`).

### 2. Inline literal

The same three ranges can be written on the command line as one literal.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan3d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    -s '[("SAM,320,CS1","GPP,321,C7",1.50,3.00),("GPP,321,H11","GLU,186,OE2",0.90,2.50),("SAM,320,SD","SAM,320,CS1",1.80,3.00)]'
```

### 3. L-BFGS, dump, and pre-optimization

Optimize the input before the scan, relax each point with L-BFGS, keep the inner-loop trajectories, and measure the relative energies from the lowest usable point.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan3d -i input.pdb -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    -s '[("SAM,320,CS1","GPP,321,C7",1.50,3.00),("GPP,321,H11","GLU,186,OE2",0.90,2.50),("SAM,320,SD","SAM,320,CS1",1.80,3.00)]' \
    --max-step-size 0.20 --dump -o ./result_scan3d/ --opt-mode grad \
    --preopt --baseline min
```

### 4. Re-plot an existing surface.csv

Redraw the isosurfaces of a finished grid over −10 to 40 kcal/mol; no energy is computed. A separate `-o` keeps the files of the original scan.

```bash
pdb2reaction scan3d --csv ./result_scan3d/surface.csv --zmin -10 --zmax 40 -o ./result_scan3d_replot/
```

---

## How it works

1. **Starting structure and grid**:
The {ref}`charge <charge-specification>` comes from `-q` or `-l`. With `--preopt`, the input is first optimized without restraints; if that does not converge, the input geometry is used. Each axis gets ceil(|high − low| / h) + 1 evenly spaced values, both ends included, where h is `--max-step-size` (Å) for a distance and `--max-angle-step-size` or `--max-dihedral-step-size` (degrees) for an angle or dihedral. The values are visited from the one closest to the starting structure.
2. **Three nested loops**:
For each d₁ value, the structure is relaxed with only the d₁ restraint; for each d₂ value, with the d₁ and d₂ restraints; the inner loop then scans d₃ with all three restraints. Each relaxation starts from the nearest structure that has already converged in the same loop; until one has, it starts from the structure the enclosing loop produced (the starting structure for d₁).
3. **Relaxation at each point**:
A harmonic restraint E = ½ k (q − q_target)² holds each coordinate q at its target (k is `--restraint-k`), and L-BFGS (`--opt-mode grad`, default) or RFO (`--opt-mode hess`) relaxes the rest. The energy is then computed without the restraints, and the structure is written under `grid/`.
4. **Table and figure**:
After the last point, all points go into `surface.csv`. The usable points are interpolated with radial basis functions (RBF) on a 50 × 50 × 50 grid, and eight semi-transparent isosurfaces with banded colors are drawn in `scan3d_density.html`. With `--csv`, only this step runs, on the given table.

## Reading surface.csv

`surface.csv` has one row per grid point and one reference row.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `i`, `j`, `k` | Grid indices. Index 0 is the value closest to the starting structure, so the indices follow the visiting order, not ascending values |
| `d1_A`, `d2_A`, `d3_A` (also `q1`, `q2`, `q3`) | Coordinate values measured after the relaxation. The `_A` names are kept for every axis, so an angle axis holds degrees; `q1_unit`, `q2_unit`, and `q3_unit` give the unit (`angstrom` or `degree`) |
| `target_d1_A`, `target_d2_A`, `target_d3_A` (also `target_q1`, `target_q2`, `target_q3`) | Restraint targets of the point |
| `energy_hartree` | Energy without the restraints (Hartree) |
| `bias_converged` | Whether the restrained relaxation converged |
| `is_preopt` | `true` only for the reference row |
| `energy_kcal` | Energy relative to the baseline (kcal/mol) |
| `d1_label`, `d2_label`, `d3_label` | Axis labels used in the figure |

* **Usable points**: a point is usable when its relaxation converged, its energy is finite, and its structure was written. Only usable points set the baseline and enter the figure.
* **Verdict**: in `result.json` (`--out-json`), `scientific_status` is `success` when every grid point is usable, `partial` when only some are (exit status 0), and `failed` when none is (exit status 1). `n_points_attempted` and `n_points_usable` give the counts. For points that do not converge, see {ref}`max_cycles and plateau stops <troubleshooting-max-cycles>`.
* **Next step**: the isosurfaces are interpolated, so pass a computed point near the saddle, `grid/point_*.pdb`, to [`tsopt`](tsopt.md) (for `.xyz`, add `--ref-pdb`). Points in the reactant and product basins can be inputs for [`path-search`](path-search.md).

## Output files

After a run, `--out-dir` contains the following files.

```text
result_scan3d/
├─ surface.csv                          # grid table with the reference row
├─ scan3d_density.html                  # 3D isosurfaces (open in a browser)
├─ grid/
│  ├─ point_i150_j090_k180.xyz          # relaxed structure of each grid point
│  ├─ preopt_iDDD_jDDD_kDDD.xyz         # starting structure (the reference row)
│  └─ inner_path_d1_000_d2_000_trj.xyz  # inner-loop trajectory for each (d₁, d₂) pair (--dump)
└─ result.json                          # summary (--out-json); summary.json holds the same content
```

Start with `scan3d_density.html` and `surface.csv`; the structure of each point is under `grid/`. In `result.json`, `grid_points[]` maps each grid index to its values, targets, energy, convergence, and structure file.

* **File names**: the number after `i`, `j`, or `k` (the tag `DDD`) is the target × 100 (Å, or degrees for an angle), padded to at least three digits, not the grid index of `surface.csv`: `d1 = 1.50 Å, d2 = 0.90 Å, d3 = 1.80 Å` gives `point_i150_j090_k180.xyz`, and an angle of 120° gives `12000`. When two points round to the same tag, the later file name gets `_grid_III_JJJ_KKK` with the point's `i`, `j`, and `k` from `surface.csv`; the numbers in `inner_path_d1_000_d2_000` are the `i` and `j` of the pair.
* **Other formats**: with PDB or mmCIF input, each structure is also written as `.pdb`, and with Gaussian input as `.gjf`. {ref}`mmCIF input <mmcif-input>` also gets `.cif` with the original identifiers.
* **With `--csv`**: only `scan3d_density.html` is written, plus `result.json` (without `grid_points`) with `--out-json`.

## Notes

* **Three ranges in one literal**: `-s` takes exactly three ranges, in one inline literal or under `pairs:` in a YAML/JSON file. For staged scans, use [`scan`](scan.md).
* **PDB with chains**: the {ref}`positional form <scan-list-spec>` `A:SAM:320:CS1` picks one atom without ambiguity.
* **Grid size**: the number of relaxations is the product of the three axis lengths and grows quickly (567 for example 1). Start with a larger `--max-step-size` or narrower ranges.
* **`--baseline first`**: zero is put at point `(i, j, k) = (0, 0, 0)` when it is usable; otherwise the run prints `[baseline] 'first' requested but no eligible (i=0,j=0,k=0); using eligible minimum instead.` and uses the lowest usable point.
* **Cap hydrogens**: `--freeze-links` (default on) fixes the parent atoms of the {ref}`cap hydrogens <link-hydrogen-and-frozen-atoms>` of an extracted cluster.
* **Check the spec without computing**: `--dry-run` reads the input, the charge and spin, and `-s`, prints the plan, and exits without any optimization. With `--csv`, it checks only the options.
* **Cycle limit**: `--relax-max-cycles` (default `100000`) limits each relaxation; an explicit value overrides YAML `opt.max_cycles`.
* **Reference row**: `i = j = k = -1` and `is_preopt = true` hold the starting structure. The row stays in the table but is never a grid point, a baseline, or a plotted point.
* **Re-plotting a table (`--csv`)**: the table needs `d1_A`, `d2_A`, `d3_A`, and `energy_hartree` or `energy_kcal`. The reference row and rows with `bias_converged = false` or a non-finite energy are left out.
* **Too few usable points**: with fewer than four usable points, or with all of them in one plane, only the figure is skipped. The run prints `[plot] NOTE: Volume plot skipped: …` and exits with status 0. With no usable point it prints `[plot] No finite data for plotting.` and exits with status 1.
* **Running again into the same `--out-dir`**: a run without `--out-json`, a full scan or a `--csv` redraw, removes `result.json` and `summary.json` from `--out-dir`; a run with it overwrites them, and every run replaces `scan3d_density.html`.
