# Tests Layout

`pdb2reaction` uses `tests/` as the single test root.

## Unit and CI Tests

CPU-only tests live directly under `tests/*.py`.

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short -x
```

These tests cover CLI parsing, helper contracts, logging summaries, geometry
regressions. They are suitable for CI.

## Manual Smoke Tests

GPU smoke fixtures and commands live in `tests/smoke/`.

```bash
cd tests/smoke
bash run.sh
```

`tests/smoke/run.sh` assumes the caller has already configured the Python
environment and CUDA runtime. Scheduler wrappers and environment activation
must stay out of the repository.
