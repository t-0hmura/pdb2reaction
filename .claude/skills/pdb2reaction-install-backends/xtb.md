# xTB / ALPB solvent layer (xtb.md)

`pdb2reaction` can apply an xTB-ALPB **implicit solvent correction** to
any backend-computed energy. The correction is a separate semi-empirical
SCF call that adds a continuum-solvation term; it is optional and
turned off by default.

## When to use

| Use it when | Skip it when |
|---|---|
| You need a quick, approximate solvent correction for a bare cluster | Fully embedded QM/MM or explicit waters (use `mlmm_toolkit`) |
| Comparing barrier heights between gas-phase and solvated approximation | Reporting absolute solvent free energies (xTB-ALPB is empirical) |
| Substrate is in a public-friendly solvent (water, DMSO, methanol, …) | Solvent isn't in the ALPB parameter set (unusual organics) |

## Install

Two routes; pick whichever your env can use.

**Route A — `xtb` Python bindings (recommended, pip-installable):**

```bash
pip install xtb
```

The PyPI package name is `xtb` (not `xtb-python`); the import name is
also `xtb`.

Verify:

```bash
python -c "import xtb; print('xtb:', xtb.__version__)"
```

**Route B — system `xtb` binary (xtb 6.7+):**

If your site already has `xtb` as a module or in `$PATH`:

```bash
xtb --version
which xtb
```

`pdb2reaction` calls the binary via subprocess when it can't find the
Python bindings. Make sure `xtb` is on `$PATH` for any PBS / SLURM job
that needs it.

## CLI usage

The solvent correction wraps any other calculator transparently:

```bash
pdb2reaction all -i 1.R.pdb 3.P.pdb \
    -c 'SAM,GPP,MG' -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    --tsopt --thermo \
    --solvent water        # ALPB water on top of MLIP
```

Available solvents (pass to `--solvent`): `water`, `methanol`, `ethanol`,
`acetone`, `acetonitrile`, `dmso`, `dmf`, `chloroform`, `dichloromethane`,
`hexane`, `benzene`, `toluene`, `thf`. The exact list comes from xTB's
ALPB parameter set; check `xtb --help` for the most current options.

To turn off: simply omit `--solvent` or pass `--solvent none`.

## How it composes with MLIP / DFT

The corrected energy at each step is:

```
E_total = E_MLIP_or_DFT (in vacuo) + ΔE_ALPB (xTB)
```

The ALPB term is computed from the same atomic positions as the
backbone calculator, so it's geometry-consistent. Whenever `--solvent`
is set, the ALPB gradient is added to the MLIP / DFT forces so the
optimizer feels the solvent — there is no separate flag to toggle this.

## Known gotchas

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `xtb-python` import fails on aarch64 | Wheel not yet published for ARM. Use Route B (system binary). |
| `xtb` binary version too old (< 6.7) | ALPB introduced in 6.4 but parameter set updated repeatedly; upgrade if results disagree with documentation. |
| Different barrier vs literature | Could be `--solvent` mismatch or the literature used a different solvation model (CPCM / SMD). State the model in any comparison. |
