# pdb2reaction Workflows and Output Parsing

## Overview

This skill ties the per-subcommand mds in `pdb2reaction-cli/` together
into **end-to-end recipes** and explains how to read the resulting
output trees, JSON, and figures. Use this when you have a goal
("compute the barrier of step 1 of this enzyme") and want the path
through the toolkit.

## Six canonical workflows

### 1. Cluster + 1-step reaction (multi-input MEP)

You have R and P PDBs (from a published QM study). One step.

```bash
pdb2reaction all -i 1.R.pdb 3.P.pdb \
    -c 'SAM,GPP,MG' -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    --tsopt --thermo \
    -o result_mep
```

Result: `result_mep/seg_NN/{reactant,ts,product}.pdb`,
`summary.json["segments"][0]["barrier_kcal"]`.

### 2. Multi-step recursive (multi-input MEP, recursive segmentation)

You have R and P. The mechanism is multi-step, but you don't have
intermediates handy. Path-search recursively segments by detecting
bond changes.

```bash
pdb2reaction all -i 1.R.pdb 3.P.pdb \
    -c '...' -l '...' \
    --tsopt --thermo \
    -o result_mep
```

The output `summary.json["n_segments"]` may be > 1 — that's the
recursion finding intermediates the inputs didn't contain.

### 3. Single-input scan-list (when only R is available)

You have just the reactant. Articulate the reaction as a sequence of
distance-restraint scans.

```bash
pdb2reaction all -i 1.R.pdb \
    -c '...' -l '...' \
    --scan-lists '[("CS1 SAM 320","GPP 321 C7",1.60)]' \
                 '[("GPP`321/H11","GLU`186/OE2",0.90)]' \
    --tsopt --thermo \
    -o result_scan
```

Each `--scan-lists` argument is one stage. See
`pdb2reaction-cli/all-scan-list.md` for syntax details.

### 4. Endpoint-MEP with explicit intermediates

You have R, IM₁, IM₂, P from the literature. Pass them all in order:

```bash
pdb2reaction all -i 1.R.pdb 2.IM1.pdb 3.IM2.pdb 4.P.pdb \
    -c '...' -l '...' \
    --tsopt --thermo \
    -o result_mep_4pt
```

Recursive segmentation still runs *between* adjacent endpoints, so
you don't have to provide every elementary step.

### 5. TS-only validation (existing TS candidate)

You have a TS guess from another code or a prior run. Skip
extract / path-search:

```bash
pdb2reaction tsopt -i ts.xyz -q -1 -m 1 -b uma -o result_tsopt
pdb2reaction freq  -i result_tsopt/final_geometry.xyz -q -1 -m 1 -b uma -o result_freq
pdb2reaction irc   -i result_tsopt/final_geometry.xyz -q -1 -m 1 -b uma -o result_irc
```

Or use `pdb2reaction all` with a single `-i` (collapses to TS-only
mode automatically; see `pdb2reaction-cli/all-ts-only.md`).

### 6. DFT//MLIP refinement

After any of the above, refine R / TS / P energies at DFT level:

```bash
pdb2reaction dft -i seg_01/reactant.pdb \
    -l 'SAM:1,GPP:-3' \
    --func-basis 'wb97m-v/def2-tzvpd' \
    --engine gpu \
    -o dft_R
pdb2reaction dft -i seg_01/ts.pdb       -l '...' --func-basis '...' -o dft_TS
pdb2reaction dft -i seg_01/product.pdb  -l '...' --func-basis '...' -o dft_P
```

Composite the energies with `energy-diagram` (see below).

## summary.json schema (`pdb2reaction all` output)

Top-level keys:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `command` | The subcommand (`"all"`, `"tsopt"`, …) |
| `pdb2reaction_version` | Toolkit version that produced this output |
| `status` | `"completed"`, `"error"`, `"not_converged"` |
| `elapsed_seconds` | Wall-clock duration |
| `charge` / `spin` | Resolved cluster charge / multiplicity |
| `environment` | `{device, gpu_name, gpu_vram_gb, cuda_version, cpu, n_cpus, ram_gb}` |
| `config` | Full effective config after CLI + YAML + defaults merge |
| `freeze_atoms` | Indices held fixed during optimization (link-H parents) |
| `n_segments` | Number of elementary steps detected |
| `n_segments_reactive` | Number of segments with non-empty bond changes |
| `rate_limiting_step` | Index of the highest-barrier segment |
| `overall_reaction_energy_kcal` | R → P total energy difference |
| `segments` | List, one per elementary step (see below) |
| `post_segments` | Per-segment post-processing details |
| `key_output_files` | Map of role → path (mep_pdb, energy_diagrams, …) |
| `pipeline_mode` | Internal mode tag |
| `mlip_backend` | Which backend produced the energies |
| `energy_diagrams` | Paths to PNG / HTML diagrams |

Per-segment keys (`summary.json["segments"][i]`):

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `index` | Segment index (`01`, `03`, …) |
| `barrier_kcal` | TS – R energy (kcal/mol) — the rate constant input |
| `delta_kcal` | P – R energy (kcal/mol) |
| `bond_changes` | List of dicts (one per consecutive frame pair): `[{"Bond formed (k)": ["A — B : 3.17 Å -> 1.68 Å", ...], "Bond broken (k)": [...]}]`. Default cutoff is 1.20× covalent radii (with internal margin 0.05) — see `pdb2reaction-cli/bond-summary.md`. |
| `structures` | Map: `reactant`, `ts`, `product` → file paths |
| `tsopt` | `{status, energy_hartree, n_imaginary_modes, imaginary_frequencies_cm}` |
| `irc` | `{n_frames_forward, n_frames_backward, energies_*, bond_changes}` |
| `freq` | `{n_imaginary, frequencies_cm, thermochemistry: {...}}` |
| `dft` | `{energy_hartree, method, status}` (when `--dft` was passed) |

## R/TS/P canonical paths

Two locations get written for each elementary step:

```
result_all/
├── seg_NN/                                 # CANONICAL — top-level, post-LBFGS optimized
│   ├── reactant.{xyz,pdb}                  # IRC backward endpoint, then LBFGS-optimized
│   ├── ts.{xyz,pdb}                        # tsopt'd transition state
│   └── product.{xyz,pdb}                   # IRC forward endpoint, then LBFGS-optimized
└── result/path_search/post_seg_NN/structures/
    ├── reactant.{xyz,pdb}                  # same as above (canonical) — nested copy
    ├── reactant_irc.{xyz,pdb}              # raw IRC backward end (pre-LBFGS)
    ├── ts.{xyz,pdb}                        # same as above
    ├── product.{xyz,pdb}                   # same as above (canonical)
    └── product_irc.{xyz,pdb}               # raw IRC forward end (pre-LBFGS)
```

**Rule of thumb**: read from `seg_NN/` for downstream stages. Use
`reactant_irc.xyz` / `product_irc.xyz` only when debugging
IRC vs. LBFGS divergence.

`bond_changes` are computed from `reactant.xyz` / `product.xyz`
(post-LBFGS), not from the raw IRC endpoints.

## Programmatic key extraction

```python
import json

# Per-segment barriers
d = json.load(open("result_all/summary.json"))
for seg in d["segments"]:
    print(f"seg_{seg['index']:02d}: ΔE‡ = {seg['barrier_kcal']:.1f} kcal/mol, "
          f"ΔE = {seg['delta_kcal']:.1f} kcal/mol")

# Rate-limiting barrier
rls = d["rate_limiting_step"]
print(f"rate-limiting: seg_{rls:02d}, barrier = "
      f"{d['segments'][rls-1]['barrier_kcal']:.1f} kcal/mol")

# DFT//MLIP energies (when --dft was used)
for seg in d["segments"]:
    if "dft" in seg and seg["dft"]["status"] == "completed":
        print(seg["index"], seg["dft"]["energy_hartree"])

# Imaginary-mode check on every TS
for seg in d["segments"]:
    n = seg["tsopt"]["n_imaginary_modes"]
    if n != 1:
        print(f"WARNING: seg_{seg['index']:02d} has {n} imaginary modes")
```

## Bond-change interpretation

`segments[i]["bond_changes"]` looks like:

```json
{
  "formed":  ["CS1(SAM 320) — C7(GPP 321)", "OE2(GLU 186) — H11(GPP 321)"],
  "broken":  ["CS1(SAM 320) — S(SAM 320)", "C7(GPP 321) — H11(GPP 321)"]
}
```

Reading rules:

- `formed` lists bonds that exist in P but not R (covalent-radius
  cutoff 1.3×).
- `broken` lists bonds that exist in R but not P.
- For a single elementary step you usually expect 1–4 entries combined.
- If a single segment shows > 8 bond changes, the recursive
  segmentation may have failed — inspect the geometries before trusting
  the barrier.

## Failed-run output

When `summary.json["status"] != "completed"`, look at:

1. `summary.log` — human-readable, prints the failure point first.
2. `post_seg_NN/<stage>/result.json` — per-stage status (which step
   crashed).
3. `post_seg_NN/<stage>/<stage>.log` — stack trace if any.

Even on failed runs, partial outputs are kept:

- `path_search/seg_NN/` exists for any segment that completed
  path-search (even if downstream stages failed).
- `seg_NN/` (top-level) is **only populated** for fully-successful
  segments.

## Energy diagrams

`pdb2reaction all` writes `path_search/energy_diagram_*.png`:

- `energy_diagram_MEP.png` — bare MEP energies from the path-search
  string (MLIP, no thermochemistry).
- `energy_diagram_UMA_all.png` (etc.) — per-segment energies for
  whichever backend was used.
- `energy_diagram_G_UMA_all.png` — Gibbs free-energy diagram with
  QRRHO thermochemistry (when `--thermo`).

To compose a custom diagram from energies of multiple runs, use
`pdb2reaction-cli/energy-diagram.md`:

```bash
pdb2reaction energy-diagram \
    --states 'R:0.0' 'TS1:21.5' 'IM:-0.7' 'TS2:2.2' 'P:-18.2' \
    -o my_diagram.png
```
